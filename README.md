# New-York-City-Taxi-Trip-Duration

The goal of this project is to accurately predict trip duration of a NYC taxi ride.
This algorithm should be accompanied by clean training data of the format provided by the New York City Taxi Trip Duration competition.
It will be clear which variables contained in the algorithm are engineered. Some are straight forward to engineer, others you may need to ask.
